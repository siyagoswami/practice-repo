        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! My name is Siya Goswami, and I am so excited to start this data storytelling challenge! Here are a couple of quick snippets about me and my life.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I am a rising <b>second-year student</b> at the <b>George Washington University.</b></li>
            <li>I am studying <b>international affairs and computer science</b>, hoping to work in technology and international development.</li>
            <li>I am from <b>South Brunswick, New Jersey.</b></li>
            <li>I love to read! I am currently reading <i>Cleopatra and Frankenstein</i> by Coco Mellors, and it is a really emotional, dramatic, and sentimental read. My favorite series of all time is <b>Sarah J. Maas' <i>A Court of Thorns and Roses</i></b> though.</i></li>
            <li>I also love to write in my spare time, plus dance. I did <b>ballet</b> until high school, and I am now part of my university's <b>bhangra</b> (an Indian folk dance) team. I love doing bollywood and hip-hop choreographies on the side!</li>
            <li>My current favorite album is <i>So Close To What</i> by Tate McRae. She's such an icon and I love her!</li>
            <li>I love to travel and visit new places. I especially love going to the <b>beach and trying new restaurants.</b></li>
            <li> I LOVE <b>coffee</b>. But I'm trying to drink it less often because I know it's not the healthiest. I also LOVE boba/bubble tea.</li>
            <li>Last but not least, I love Kode With Klossy and am so excited to be back in the inaugural cohort of this alumni challenge. I'm hoping to gain some <b>valuable skills and an incredible experience!</b></li>
        </ul>

        <p>That's all for now. Thank you for visiting my About Me page!</p>
